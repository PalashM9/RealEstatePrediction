# Real Estate Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning models. It appears to evaluate different algorithms, including Decision Tree and Random Forest, to establish the most effective model for price prediction.

## Libraries Used
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Key Findings
The key findings section will summarize the most significant insights from the data analysis and model evaluation.

## Conclusions
Conclusions will provide a summary of the model performance and potential recommendations for real estate price prediction.

## Setup and Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the above-mentioned libraries. You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn sklearn
